# td-berlin/data-engineer-challenge

_Foreword: First, thank you! I appreciate your effort here. I've been in your position before - so I know what it's like. Please [reach out to me](mailto:d.stevenson@reply.de?subject=Enquiry%20[data-engineer-challenge]) with your questions or feedback. You are an expert and a self-learner. So use this opportunity to show us what you're good at, and - even better - learn something new (make sure to document both of these - it helps us evaluate your work). Looking forward to your solution! - Daniel_

## Introduction

At TD Reply, we collect, integrate, analyze, and distribute data from many different sources. Connecting to APIs and databases is our 'bread and butter'.

**How you communicate your work is important** - Software engineers read code more than they write it. Tests are a great way to communicate use and function.

**We assume 4 hours of effort** - But feel free to take as much or as little time as you want.

**Use Git(Hub)** - Work as if you are collaborating in a team.

**Use Python as the core of your project.** - But **we encourage using other languages/frameworks** to supplement/complete your project.

**Your solution should be self-contained** - meaning we should not require additional software or research to run it.

## Challenge Option One

1. Choose a public API to collect data from. **Document why you chose this API.**

  - Some suggestions: <https://github.com/public-apis/public-apis>

2. **Use Python to build a class or classes to query your chosen API**. Your code should do the following at a basic level:

  - handle errors
  - write information to a log file
  - be configurable

3. **Document and demonstrate how to set up, install, and run a data pull** using your code.

## Challenge Option Two

1. Store this [dataset of Amazon product reviews](https://s3.amazonaws.com/amazon-reviews-pds/readme.html) in a database of your choice. **Document why you chose this database**. You **do not** have to provide documentation or code demonstrating how you did this.

2. **Use Python to build a class or classes to query your chosen database** Your code should do the following at a basic level:

  - handle errors
  - write information to a log file
  - be configurable

3. **Document and demonstrate using how to set up, install, and run a data pull** using your code.

## Submitting

Send an email to [Daniel](mailto:d.stevenson@reply.de?subject=Challenge%20Complete%20[data-engineer-challenge]), [Holger](mailto:h.noesekabel@reply.de?subject=Challenge%20Complete%20[data-engineer-challenge]), and your recruitment contact when you're done.

- _Important: It is possible you could lose access to this GitHub repo after this point_

## Final Tips:

- Assume you are going to be code reviewed.
- Got an idea for a cool feature to add? Do it! We love to see your creative side.
